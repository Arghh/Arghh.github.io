## Background Story

I'm looking for a flat in Hamburg and it's not going to good - been on the hunt for a month now. The real estate situation there is [insane.](http://immobilien-kompass.capital.de/hamburg/eimsbuettel-stadtbezirk/eimsbuettel-stadtteil) Affordable flats in a loved quarter (*f.e Altona, Ottensen, Eimsb√ºttel*) stay online for about two to three hours and in that time the landlord/real estate agent will receives on average about **200** emails (*So the agents have told me, to whom I've talked to about this problem.*) 

That means, I need to be constantly online and hit the refresh button on the big 3,4 real eastet portals in Germany. Between job and school I don't have the time to do that, which means I miss out on a lot of good offers.
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Solution

I need a program, that checks the portals I want, searches for the keywords I find interesting and then reports back to me (*f.e via email*), if there are any new offers, that would interest me. I need it running, even when I'm not home and I need a way to check if it's doing what it's supposed to (*f.e log a simple message*). A quick Google search and I landed on [this page](http://www.wohnungsengel.de/), which offers something, what I'm looking for. I tried it for a week, but the free version does not work as fast and exactly like I want it to, so I decide to write some code myself!
<br>
<br>
<br>

## First Try

So I open my Visual Studio - as I always do when I want to write some code (*My goto IDE*). After a half a days work I finish a *web-crawler-like* console tool, that searches the websites, I tell him to and saves the links, that he finds, in a HTML-doc, that I can then check. I used [Abot](https://github.com/sjdirect/abot) to help me. Turned out ok. 

Now for the second part - I need it to run without me sitting at the computer. Better yet - not at all on my PC, because I don't want to have it on the whole day. **Eureka moment!** I have a [PI](http://arghh.github.io/Raspberry-Pi/), I copy the program there and find some script to run the program for me! Wait a minute, my PI is running a Debian based lightweight OS called [DIETPI](http://dietpi.com/). Great! My Visual Studio compiled code is useless :(

I need a break ..
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### Lesson learned

**Think my steps through until the very end BEFORE writing any code ..**
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Second Try

Actually what I needed is a script and not a program AND I need it to run on any OS. Something valuable I learned at this point - Always use the tools, that best help you solve a given problem and don't be afraid to pick a something, that you are not so familiar with. So I googled a bit and picked **Python**. Installed it on my desktop (*to code and debug*) and later on my PI to run the script. All the needed packages I ended up using, I got over PIP (*Package management system for Python*) and to run my script I just used command line. After one day I had a script, that was only 70 lines of code and did everything I my C# program did plus a lot more. I copied it to the PI and it all worked fine.

Now for the second part - *that I failed on my first try* - run it automatically. I found [cron](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/cron.md) to do the trick.

<br>
<br>
*cron service status tab*

## Conclusion

For 2 weeks now I've not missed an offer and I've learned some python!
