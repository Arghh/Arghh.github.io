title: I'm up and learning!

**Hello World!**
It's me, trying to get started in the wonderful and crazy world of web development. Which might seem overwhelming at start, but with time, comes confidence and skills. The more you know, the more everything will start making sense. There is no better feeling then trying something new out for the first time and then realizing - **"HEI!** It wasn't totally new at all, I already knew some of it, when I tried the **Z**-thing last night."

So all I need to do is learn **Z-1** things! Well then there are also all those other things before **Z** like **A,B,C** and what they are exactly is unclear to me, because they keep changing daily. But some day I'll get there ..
