title: C is wonderful
---
So I have been getting deeper into C#. Last week I wrote my first tiny [programs](https://github.com/Arghh/code-samples) in C# to learn about classes, methods, refences etc in C# and get the first taste of Object-oriented programming.

**Everything in C# is an object**

Currently I'm learning about C and moving into C++. Those two, especially C, make C# look so safe and easy. (*Which it is of course!*) 
C seems so outdated I must say, but it's still used, but not as widely of course as C++ and it will be used for a long time even tho it's over 30 years old!(*talking about C++ of course*).
The reason is: it's **faster** then C#.

I would not recommend it for a beginner like myself tho. I wrote some basic string manipulation [functions](https://github.com/Arghh/code-samples/blob/master/string.cpp) in C++, to practice the syntax, and it was a pain.
So I'm gonna definitely stick to C# from now on. Much more programer-friendly. Much more noob friendly. Java and C# if you wanna get your hands dirty in OOP.

Meanwhile check out this [great site](http://www.sanfoundry.com/) I found for learn basics about programming languages. Fun for beginners and intermediates.
