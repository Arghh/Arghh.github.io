title: C is wonderful
---
So I have been getting deeper into C#. Last week I wrote my first tiny [programs](https://github.com/Arghh/code-samples) in C# to learn about classes, methods, references etc in C# and get the first taste of Object-oriented programming.

Note-to-self: **Everything in C# is an object**

Currently I'm learning about C and moving into C++. Those two, especially C, make C# look so safe and easy. (*Which it is of course!*) 
C seems so outdated, if I'm been honest, but yet it exist and is been learned. Not as widely of course as C++ but still. That language will never die or at least, it will be used for a long-long time after we are gone, even tho it's over 30 years old! (*talking here about C++ of course*).
Easy explanation: it is just that much more **faster** than C#.

I would not recommend C++ for a beginner like myself tho. I wrote some basic string manipulation [functions](https://github.com/Arghh/code-samples/blob/master/string.cpp) to practice the syntax and to compare it to C#, it was a pain in the ass.

So I'm gonna definitely stick to C# from now on. Much more programer-friendly. Much more noob friendly. Java and C# if you wanna get your hands dirty in OOP.

Meanwhile check out this [great site](http://www.sanfoundry.com/) I found for learn basics about programming languages. Fun for beginners and intermediates.
