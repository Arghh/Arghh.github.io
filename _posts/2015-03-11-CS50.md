title: Time to get serious

After the initial rush and learning all you can ~~forfree~~ comes an inevitable low on the progressbar. It is hard, one might even call it a **turning point** on your road to success.

You will have to decide, how you want to proceed from here. Hard? Very! It depends a lot on where you live and what is the "common practice" in your country of residence, but you will probably have to choose between the following **choices:**

  1. Try to score an Internship (_Ausbildung in German_) at an IT Company. Might be tricky, since there are a few companies, that dare to take people with no working experience and pay them money for learning, 
  but if you are lucky enough then this **is** the right way to go. Nothing replaces a "_real_" working experience in my book.
                                                
  2. If you don't have a possibility to learn and work at the same time, then just keep on learning! After the _free-for-all_ offers do not help you forward anymore, then just keep going. Trust me, it's worth it! Great way to go on, is by sign up for a course, which you actually have to **pay** for. I'm sorry BUT: 
   *  It shows **You** are serious and want to invest in **Your** future.
   *  You might get a certificate and actually score a job.
                                              
                                                
But which course to choose? What is the best one out there: not overpriced and yet still has some value?                                  

**Good question!** 

There are **a lot** of offers out there. Something for everybody - so to say. So **here** are a few, that I've looked into:

 1. [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/paths) is relative cheap
and nice place to learn. Focus on all kinds of thing, but I don't think it will
help you "land a job."

 2. [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/) has a lot of different courses, a great place to learn f.e about Google products and a lot more. Bonus: 
 
It will also give you a [certificate](https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent.screencast.com%2Fusers%2FGKlig%2Ffolders%2FJing%2Fmedia%2Fe63cc74a-b053-4fb8-9f1e-1704dea50594%2F00000231.png&key=afea23f29e5a4f63bd166897e3dc72df) at the end of every paid course. Additionally you can display it under your [linkedIN](https://blog.udemy.com/udemy-linkedin-add-to-profile-for-certifications/) profile page. _Nice trick by Udemy, not sure how helpful it actually is tho._
 
 3. If you don't have the time or the money to get a CS degree at a University, then I recommend signing up for [Harvards CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) course. Truely the best money can buy. You can also see it for [free](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x#.VQAswqKfuPV), but paying for it will grant you a certificate signed by the authors, that is valued by a lot of companies - so you should really consider sign up for it.
