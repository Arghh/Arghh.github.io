title: Time to get serious
---

After the initial rush and learning all you can ~~for free~~ comes a inevitable low at the progressbar. It is hard, one might even call it a turning point.
You will have to decide, how you want to proceed. Depending on where you live and what is the "common practice" in your country of residence,
you probably will have the choose between following **choices:**
  1. Try to score an Internship (Ausbildung in Germany) at an IT Company. Might be tricky, since there are a few companies that dare to take people with no working experience and pay them money for learning, 
  but if you are lucky enough then this **is** the right way to go. Nothing replaces a "real" working experience in my book.
                                                
  2. If you don't have a possibility to learn and work then just keep on learning! After the _free-for-all_ offers do not give help you forward anymore. Great way to go is sign up for a course,
                                                which you actually have to **pay** for.
                                                
 *  It shows **You** are serious and want to invest in your future.
 *  You might get a certificate and actually score a job.
                                                
But which Course to choose? What is the best one out there, not overpriced and still valued?                                  

**Good question!** There are **a lot** of offers out there, something for everybody - so to say. So **here** are a few that I've looked into:

 1. [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/paths) is relative cheap
and nice place to learn. Focus on all kinds of thing, but I don't think it will
help you "land a job."

 2. [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/) has a lot of different courses. A great place to learn about Google product and a lot more. It will also give you a [certificate](https://support.udemy.com/customer/portal/articles/1497724-how-do-i-receive-a-certificate-of-completion-?b_id=3149)in the end, which you can display under your [linkedIN](https://blog.udemy.com/udemy-linkedin-add-to-profile-for-certifications/)profile.
 3. 
 3. If you don't have the time or the money to get a CS degree at a Universtity, then I recommend sign up for [Harvards CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) course. Truely the best money can buy. You can also see it for [free](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x#.VQAswqKfuPV), but paying will grant you a cerificate, that is valued by a lot of comapines, so you should really consider it.

**Good luck at whatever you decide to do!**
