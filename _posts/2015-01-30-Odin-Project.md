If you wanna join a growing community devoted to learning web development you could check out [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/). Very practical, easy and up-to-date learning experience. Still in Beta, it is based on [Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/). If you really serious, maybe could consider it, but the cost is pretty [high](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/apply), even for such a good program.
