title: I'm up and learning!
---

Trying to get started in the wonderful and crazy world of web development. Overwhelming at start, but with time comes confidence and skills. The more you know the more everything will start making sense. Nothing better then reading, trying something new and then realizing - "HEI! It wasn't totally new at all, I already knew some of it when I tried the Z-thing last night."
So all I need to do is learn Z-1 things! Well then there are also all those other things before Z like A,B,C and what they are exactly is unclear to me, because they keep changing daily. But some day i'll get there ..
