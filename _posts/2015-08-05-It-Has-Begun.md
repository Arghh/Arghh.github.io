The Summer in Hannover has been really **[hot](https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpt1/v/t1.0-9/s843x403/11707446_10153035841360945_5479227062975742231_n.jpg?oh=9175f3d35e3bfa086443d6a077968572&oe=5683C1DD)** 
but slowly it's coming to an end. I have started my work/school life once again from the beginning.

My current focus is on the [C#](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx) programming language. It has been easy with the help of the wonderful wiki documentation that Microsoft has provided.
As an IDE our company uses [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx) which Microsoft has made free
to use for anyone at home. We are on version 2012/2013 atm but soon we will switch to 2015. The programm in general is amazing and you can programm everything starting from websites and ending with software for supermarkets with it.
And of course anything in between.

For anyone interested out there, to get the first taste of C# language I recommend [this](https://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-8295)
course by [Bob Tabor](http://www.bobtabor.com/) (also accessible [here](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C-Fundamentals-for-Absolute-Beginners)
incase you don't have a MS account.

For people more into books then videos for learning - I have also read an excellent book about C# for noobs. It's free to download and gets tweeks by the author every year. The book is called "[The C# Programming Yellow Book](http://www.robmiles.com/c-yellow-book/)"
by [Rob Miles](http://www2.hull.ac.uk/science/computer_science/our_staff/staff_profiles/rob_miles.aspx) from the University of Hull. It is a smart and well written book, with a lot of comments and tips for beginners. Also very witty and
fun to read. The book contains A LOT of easy-to-understand examples.

That was it! I will report back with my progress if I actually have an ongoing project. In the meanwhile - **enjoy the summer**!
