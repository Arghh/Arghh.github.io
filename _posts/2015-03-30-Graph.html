   <h1>The Struggel is real</h1>
   <p>So after three months of applications, emails and interviews I finally managed to secure an Internship at a local IT company. I'm happy and greatful for the chance I was given.</p>
   <p>During this time I kept track of all my applications and now it's time to sum it all up in some graphics.</p>
   <p>In total I applied to .. companies over the period starting .. and ending.</p>
   </br>
   <p>I've created a tiny statistic for you to see you, how easy or hard it is, to actually find an Ausbildung in Hannover in IT. It is based on all on my personal experience and the first applications I send where not the best so I got way more feedback for the ones I send in March then start of February. Also at the start I was too picky and might have cost me some interviews. Live and learn. Here we go.</p>
   </br>
   <p>I call it:</p>
   <h3>"Finding an Internship in Hannover as a non-native speaker 2015:"</h3>
   </br>
   
<table id="graphs">
  
    <td><p>Some idea of the fields that the most companies here are active in. I tried to catogarize them as best as I could. I tried to kept it as general as possible.</p></td>
    <td><div id="Field" style="width: 70em; height: 35em"></div></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td><p>What medium, if at all, the companies used to get back to me. Some companies did not responed even after followup emails and a phonecall.</p></td>
     <td><div id="Feedback" style="width: 70em; height: 35em"></div></td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td><p>How long it took the companies (if at all) to get back in touch. Takes a long time and can be frustrating, but you must take into concideration, that this is for something that starts in August so it's not a priority in any Firm. That's why - I guess - the long wait period. Here I am not counting the weekends, so 1 week is 5 days. As you can see waiting a month is not highly unusual.</p></td>
       <td><div id="Waited" style="width: 70em; height: 35em"></div></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><p>My general results of how well I did. As I mentioned before at the start my application and the wording of my emails was maybe not the best. So I think a lot of those, who ignored me, did not even bother to read it carefully. Plus I did not have all my certificates before March.</p></td>
      <td><div id="Answer" style="width: 70em; height: 35em"></div></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <tr>
    <td><ul>Finally my combined results. Meaning how far I made it with any given company. I categorized it into 5 stages:
    <li>Stage1: No contact</li>
    <li>Stage2: Email</li>
    <li>Stage3: Interview</li>
    <li>Stage4: Trial offered</li>
    <li>Stage5: Job offered</li></ul></td>
