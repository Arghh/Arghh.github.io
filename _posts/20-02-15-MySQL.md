**Small update:** 


Learning [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) for the past week. Wish every languages was so userfriendly. At least I feel so..
Haven't encountered a stacked and massive database yet. We'll see if it changes my mind. The easiest and most popular MySQL management program is [MyPhpAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php). Almost all web hosts have it pre-installed for you to use. So it's the obvious choice that I also picked to get started.

**Sources:** 
  * Good [place](https://www.udemy.com/mysql-database-for-beginners) to start. *(short tutorial)*.
  * Worth to check [this](http://www.mysqltutorial.org/) place. Don't waste too much time there.
  * [Here](http://www.sqlcourse.com/) is where I spent most of my time learning MySQL.
