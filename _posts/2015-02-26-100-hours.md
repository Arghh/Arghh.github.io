title: 100 hours of free time

***Hei!***

So I just received [this](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/the-beginner-s-dilemma-your-first-100-hours-of-code) 
email from [Erik](http://www.eriktrautman.com/). Just **vau!** - that's how I'd like to "waste" a 100 hours any time. This must be
the most thorough beginners guide to launching off into the world of web development I have ever seen.
This is a great starting point - or as Erik writes: "framework "hand-holding honeymoon" phase" - to get you starting on the correct 
path. This has so many good examples and tips that I'd might also go through it if I find the 100 hours.
