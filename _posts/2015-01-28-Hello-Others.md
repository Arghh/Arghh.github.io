title: Here to get YOU learning
---
### Some useful info on how to get started:
First things first. To understand what are  you getting yourself into, [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/introduction-to-web-development/what-a-web-developer-does?ref=home) are the basics in a beatiful form.



### Here are some other places worth checking:
 
 + [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) has the basics and it's a hands on learning environment without hours of boring videos.
   
 + [Khanacademy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is similar to Codecademy, but with a wider range of courses, f.e physics, algebra and even human anatomy.
   
 + [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) has a nice [Intro to CS](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101) course written in [python](https://www.python.org/)that can be challenging at times, but well worth the time and effort.
    
 + And if that all wasn't enough for you already or you know it then [Harvard](http://www.harvard.edu/) offers [this](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) for you.
