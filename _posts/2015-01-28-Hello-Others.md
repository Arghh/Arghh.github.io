<h3>some useful info on how to get started:</h3>

<p>First things first. To understand what are  you getting yourself into, [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/introduction-to-web-development/what-a-web-developer-does?ref=home) are the basics in a beatiful form.</p>

<h3>Here are some other places to look</h3>

<ul> 
    <li>[Codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) has the basics and it's a hands on learning enviroment without hours of boring videos. </li>
    <li>[Khanacademy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is similar to Codeacademy but with wider range (f.e pyshics, algerbra) and mainly meant for children.</li>
    <li> [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) has a nice [Intro to CS](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101) course written in [python](https://www.python.org/)that can be challenging at times but well worth it.</li>
    <li>And if that wasn't enough already or you will it's too basic for you then [Harvard](http://www.harvard.edu/) offers [this](https://cs50.harvard.edu/).<li>
</ul>
