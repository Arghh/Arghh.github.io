title: Here too get YOU learning
---

some useful links where to get started.
<ul> [Codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) has the basics and it's a hands on learning enviroment without hours of boring videos. 
[Khanacademy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is similar to Codeacademy but with wider range (f.e pyshics, algerbra) and mainly meant for children.
[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) has a nice [Intro to CS](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101) course written in [python](https://www.python.org/)that can be challenging at times but well worth it.
And if that wasn't enough already or you will it's too basic for you then [Harvard](http://www.harvard.edu/) offers [this](https://cs50.harvard.edu/).
</ul>
