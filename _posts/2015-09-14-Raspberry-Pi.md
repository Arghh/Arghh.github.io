Over 3 years the Raspberry Pi has gotten more and more popular. In my home country even the Prime Minister attended the [project launch](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-in-estonia-project-launch/). 

In light of that event I thought I'd write about the Pi a bit AND of course because my new [Raspberry Pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/) arrived last week.

**First things first.** The Pi is just the body of your project. You also need hands and maybe legs to make it function. You can buy a [starter kit](https://www.pretzellogix.net/2015/01/14/the-best-raspberry-pi-starter-kits-compared-and-reviewed/) or combine your own - like I did. The Pi needs power, network connection (*wireless dongle or cable*), SD-card for the OS, keyboard (*optional is the mouse, if you wanna use a desktop*) and a screen for you to see what's going on during the initial setup. Most of those things you probably have at home lying around or you can borrow them (*monitor, mouse, keyboard*) from other devices, while you set your Pi up for the first time. So you don't need that much to keep it running just power and the SD-card with software, everything else depends solely on what the Pi is set up to do. **Tip** *As a powersource you can use any mini-usb smartphone charger, but make sure it is not some cheap chinese remake, because the powerflow needs to be stable. Safe bet is just to buy a 5V charger.*


**Seconds step**

Pick an OS. There are a lot options. The [official ones](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) promoted by Pi Foundation and the self-made ones. You can have a lot of versions of linux and even lightweight Windows running on it (*NOT recommended*). I went with one lightweight and self-made one called [DietPi](http://dietpi.net/). 


**Third step**

What would you like the Pi to do for you. I set mine up as a home FTPserver, Adblocker and VPN. [Here](http://fuzon.co.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=5#p5) you will find all the soft that is ready to run on DietPi.
You can install what you want but I definitely recommend the [Pi-hole](http://pi-hole.net/) project by [Jacob Salmela](http://jacobsalmela.com/block-millions-ads-network-wide-with-a-raspberry-pi-hole-2-0/). That AdTrap is awesome, because it blocks the ads before they get sent to your client: that means it will save you bandwidth. It also has a great [Web Interface.](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--TXayQ9G5--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/1408691445589713297.jpg), which you can acces on any of the other devices on your network. Also check out [Jacobs](http://jacobsalmela.com/) other Pi-projects on hes blog, they are all worth to do.


**Alternative projects** 

There are tons of fun stuff that you can do with your Pi. Just google *"Raspberry Pi projects"*.  Here are some of my favorites:
