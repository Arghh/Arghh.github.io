# arghh.github.io

Code for my personal [blog](http://arghh.github.io/blog) about becoming a web/software developer. Started in Jan 2015. It also marks the time, when I started learning about Software Development on a more serious note.

Created with [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/). (It makes creating a [Jekyll blog](https://jekyllrb.com/) much easier.)
